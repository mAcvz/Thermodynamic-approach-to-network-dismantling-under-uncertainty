# Thermodynamic-approach-to-network-dismantling-under-uncertainty
Network dismantling and exploration under limited topological knowledge via spectral graph theory and the cavity method.


# Network Datasets

Metadata for the real-world networks used in the thesis.

## Files

- **`networks_raw_1.csv`** — 16 networks from [Netzschleuder](https://networks.skewed.de/).
- **`networks_raw_2.csv`** — Full catalogue of available networks (original properties). A subset of 20 networks was selected from here.
- **`networks_lcc_2.csv`** — The 20 selected networks from `networks_raw_2.csv`, after preprocessing: only the Largest Connected Component (LCC) is retained and weighted networks are converted to unweighted.
